The basic algorithm to solve any valid sudoku is using backtracking:  
[Sudoku | Backtracking-7](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sudoku-backtracking-7/)  
More advanced algorithm treat sudoku as an Exact Cover problem, and solve it using [Knuth's Algorithm X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X):  
[Create a Sudoku Solver in Java](https://www.baeldung.com/java-sudoku)  
To improve the algorithm, we can take a look at Crookâ€™s pencil-and-paper algorithm:
